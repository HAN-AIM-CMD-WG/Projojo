## Running the project

To make this work, you need:
* a Mac or Linux shell. (Perhaps Git-Bash can run this on Windows?)
* Docker or Docker Desktop installed.
* A container called "typedb" that is running TypeDB (I used this image: `typedb/typedb:3.0.5` )

Use `./start.sh` (Mac/Linux) to start: 
1. The frontend server
2. The backend server
3. The TypeDB container.

A browser tab should open automatically.
