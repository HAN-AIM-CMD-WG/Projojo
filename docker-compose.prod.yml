# This is the production Docker Compose file for Projojo, which uses environment variables set in Dokploy's UI.
# It includes the base Docker Compose file and overrides some settings for production use.
# The following environment variables must be set in Dokploy's Environment Variables UI:
# - TYPEDB_NEW_PASSWORD: The new password for the TypeDB server.
# - TYPEDB_HOST_NAME: The hostname of the TypeDB server (must be same as the service name in these compose files).
# - TYPEDB_PORT: The port on which the TypeDB server's gRPC port is mapped.
# - TYPEDB_STUDIO_PORT: The port on which the TypeDB server's HTTP port is mapped.
# - BACKEND_PORT: The port on which the backend service's HTTP port is mapped.
# - FRONTEND_PORT: The port on which the frontend service's HTTP port is mapped.
# - VITE_BACKEND_HOST: The hostname of the backend service as seen by the outside world.
